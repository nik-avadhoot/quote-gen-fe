//
// The application's mirror of ONE approved `calculation_default_versions` row
// (Family D, S5-1) plus the supplier credit cost from `rate_set_versions`
// (CDM-41, S7-3). Pure data, no side effects, no React.
//
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS AT ALL. The frontend has no Supabase client - every call
// goes through the Flask backend, and the backend exposes no route for any
// commercial master. So the resolver cannot read the versioned defaults from the
// database yet. It reads them from here instead, and here is a single named
// object rather than literals scattered across five call sites.
//
// It is a MIRROR, not a second authority. Every value below reproduces the
// column default the database already carries, so establishing this object moves
// no number (the A-21 discipline). When U3 delivers the Commercial Masters
// screens, this object is replaced by the resolved Pricing Basis Release and
// `versionLabel` becomes a real `calculation_default_version_id`. Until then it
// is the honest statement of what the app is actually using.
//
// THE ONE VALUE THAT IS NOT DUPLICATED. Supplier credit cost is derived from
// `CREDIT_PCT` in data/defaults.js rather than restated, because restating it
// would create exactly the two-answers problem this slice exists to remove.
// 0.015 * 100 is 1.5 exactly in IEEE-754 - asserted by the resolver fixtures, so
// the conversion cannot rot silently.
