// src/lib/constructionIdentity.js — D-11. THE ONE PLACE CONSTRUCTIONS ARE COMPARED.
//
// IDENTITY IS WHAT THE BOARD IS: four board specs + ply + both flutes + boxType
// + paper layers. Nine fields, lifted verbatim from the bridge's `existingFull`
// check, which was the only site that already had it right.
//
// ⚠️ FOUR CREATION PATHS PREVIOUSLY CARRIED THREE DIFFERENT PREDICATES AND ONE
// ABSENCE — each site redeclared its own `toStr` and its own field list:
//
//   bridge-send  9 fields (this set)          → silent reuse
//   app-import   5 fields: board specs + SECTOR
//   tab-import   6 fields: board specs + SECTOR + spec_cobb
//   tab-new      NONE
//
// They drifted because nothing held them together. `toStr` moved in here with the
// predicate for exactly that reason — same lesson as D-7 (eight SET Code
// comparisons, three conventions) and D-27 (two exporters answering differently).
// **Do not redeclare either at a call site.**
//
// ── SECTOR AND CLIENT ARE METADATA, NOT IDENTITY. THIS IS DELIBERATE ──────────
//
// Dropping `sector` from app-import and tab-import, and `spec_cobb` from
// tab-import, was RULED by the product owner on 2026-08-29:
//
//   "Two constructions with identical board specs in different sectors ARE the
//    same construction — that's the client-agnostic ruling applied consistently,
//    and sector becomes a tag rather than an identity field."
//
// **It will read as a regression to anyone who does not know that.** Two entries
// that used to coexist because their sectors differed are now one construction
// with two tags. That is the model, not a bug. See D-11 in the register.
//
// Pure: no React, no imports.

// Normalise BOTH sides the same way. The original compared `+c.ply` against
// `(+spec.ply||5)` — applying the default to the incoming side only, so an entry
// with no ply produced NaN and could never match anything, not even itself.
// Symmetric defaults make the predicate REFLEXIVE, which the entry-vs-entry
// comparison at the tab depends on. That is a deliberate, minor loosening.
//
// KNOWN BLIND SPOT, unchanged from the original and NOT fixed here: `layers` is
// compared as JSON, so it is key-order sensitive. Every entry is built by the
// creation paths in this repo, which emit the same key order, so it holds in
// practice. Making it order-independent is an identity model, and this is not one.
